I’m a Research Fellow at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), Simons Foundation, working jointly at the Center for Computational Neuroscience and the Center for Computational Mathematics. I did a Ph.D. in Data Science at the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) at New York University, advised by [Eero Simoncelli](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/). I studied Solid State Physics for my bachelor’s and Psychology for my master’s.

I'm broadly interested in vision and more specifically in **Probability Densities of Natural Images**. 
I have studied these densities from various angles: ***learning*** them from data, ***understanding and evaluating*** the learned models, and ***utilizing*** them for real-world problems. These areas are closely intertwined: understanding a learned model can inspire the design of better and more efficient ones. Conversely, practical advances can hint at something meaningful the model has captured about the underlying data structures.

I enjoy studying these complementary perspectives and seeing how they inform one another through the **scientific method**.

My work explores different aspects of these densities — learning them from data, analyzing and evaluating the resulting models, and applying them to real-world problems. These directions are closely connected: gaining insight into a learned model can suggest ways to design better ones, while practical improvements often reveal something about what the model has captured from the underlying data.

<!-- Formal / concise version

I am interested in computer vision, particularly in the probability densities of natural images.
My research focuses on learning these densities from data, analyzing and evaluating learned models, and applying them to practical problems. These areas are closely connected: understanding a model can inspire better designs, while engineering improvements can reveal insights about the underlying data distribution. Studying image densities from these complementary angles helps build both better models and a deeper understanding of visual data.

Personal / narrative version

I’m interested in vision, and especially in probability densities of natural images—how they can be learned, understood, and used.
I’ve explored these ideas from several directions: learning models from data, analyzing and evaluating what they capture, and applying them to real-world problems. These areas often inform one another: understanding a model can suggest ways to improve it, and practical advances can reveal new insights into the structure of natural images. I enjoy approaching these questions from multiple angles and learning from the connections between them.

## Learning image densities from data: 
diffusion models
- Miyasawa: denoisers embed densities 
- sampling method to show what the learned density is

papers: 
Solving inverse problem (updated version neurips)

learning normalized density mdoels 

## Understanding and Evaluating learned density models: 
what is a good model? 

curse of dimensionality

shallow understanding of deep models.
why do we care about understanding? predict when generalization and when fails
scientifc method shines: deep nets have evolves through a natural selection, we can examine them by hypothesizing about what they are and how they work, design controlled experiments to test them. 

paper: 
robust and interpretable image denoising 
generalization paper 
Learning multiscale 
representation 


## Utilizing image density models to solve inverse problems: 
Ultimately, we want to learn the density to use it! Inverse problems in signal processing (a particular approach: it is stochastic) 
### Linear 
Solving inverse problem (updated version neurips)
optimal measurement 
cone excitation
### non-linear 
- feature- guided 
- texture model
