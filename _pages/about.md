I’m a Research Fellow at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), Simons Foundation, working jointly at the Center for Computational Neuroscience and the Center for Computational Mathematics. I did a Ph.D. in Data Science at the Center for Data Science at New York University, advised by [Eero Simoncelli](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/). I studied Solid State Physics for my bachelor’s and Psychology for my master’s.

I'm interested in vision and more specifically in **Probability Densities of Natural Images**. 
I have studied different aspects of these densities: *learning* them from data, *understanding and evaluating* the learned models, and *utilizing* them for real-world problems. These areas are quite intertwined and the boundaries between them are fuzzy: understanding a learned model can inspire the design of better and more efficient ones. Conversely, when engineeing creativity leads to improved performance, it often hints at something meaningful the model has captured about the "true" natural image density. 

<!-- yet I find it helpful to draw fuzzy boundaries between them to better navigate this rich landscape.  -->

I approach these questions using the **scientific method**. 


## Learning image densities from data: 

- curse of dimensionality
- Miyasawa: denoisers embed densities 
- sampling method to show what the learned density is

papers: 
Solving inverse problem (updated version neurips)
learning normalized density mdoels 

## Understanding and Evaluating learned density models: 
what is a good model? 
shallow understanding of deep models.
why do we care about understanding? predict when generalization and when fails
scientifc method shines: deep nets have evolves through a natural selection, we can examine them by hypothesizing about what they are and how they work, design controlled experiments to test them. 

paper: 
robust and interpretable image denoising 
generalization paper 
Learning multiscale 
representation 


## Utilizing image density mdoels to solve inverse problems: 
Ultimately, we want to learn the density to use it! Inverse problems in signal processing (a particular approach: it is stochastic) 
### Linear 
Solving inverse problem (updated version neurips)
optimal measurement 
cone excitation
### non-linear 
- feature- guided 
- texture model
