I’m a Research Fellow at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), Simons Foundation, working jointly at the Center for Computational Neuroscience and the Center for Computational Mathematics. I did a Ph.D. in Data Science at the Center for Data Science at New York University, advised by [Eero Simoncelli](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/). I studied Solid State Physics for my bachelor’s and Psychology for my master’s.

I'm interested in **Probability Densities of Natural Images** and have studied different aspects of these densities: *learning*, *understanding*, and *utilizing* them for real-world problems.
