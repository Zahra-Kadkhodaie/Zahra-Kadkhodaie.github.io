I’m a Research Fellow at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/), Simons Foundation, working jointly at the Center for Computational Neuroscience and the Center for Computational Mathematics. I did a Ph.D. in Data Science at the Center for Data Science at New York University, advised by [Eero Simoncelli](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/). I studied Solid State Physics for my bachelor’s and Psychology for my master’s.

I'm interested in vision and more specifically in **Probability Densities of Natural Images**. I have studied different aspects of these densities: *learning*, *understanding*, and *utilizing* them for real-world problems. 
These aspects are tightly intertwined, yet it is helpful to draw fuzzy boundaries to distinguish them. 

I approach these problems using the **scientific method**. 


## Learning an image density from data: 

- curse of dimensionality
- Miyasawa: denoisers embed densities 
- sampling method to show what the learned density is


papers: 
Solving inverse problem (updated version neurips)
learning normalized density mdoels 

## Understanding: 
A good model: what is a good model? 
why do we care? predict when generalization and when fails
scientifc method shines: deep nets have evolves through a natural selection, we can examine them by hypothesizing about what they are and how they work, design controlled experiments to test them. 

paper: 
robust and interpretable image denoising 
generalization paper 
Learning multiscale 
representation 


## Using image densities to solve inverse problems: 
Ultimately, we want to learn the density to use it! Inverse problems in signal processing (a particular approach: it is stochastic) 
#### Linear 
Solving inverse problem (updated version neurips)
optimal measurement 
cone excitation
#### non linear 
- feature- guided 
- texture model
